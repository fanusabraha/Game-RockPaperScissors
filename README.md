# Rock Paper Scissors Game

## Overview
This Java program simulates the classic "Rock, Paper, Scissors" game. It allows the user to play against the computer. The computer randomly chooses one of the three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the user inputs their choice. The game then determines the winner based on the standard rules of the game.

## How to Play
1. The user is prompted to input a move:
   - "r" for Rock
   - "p" for Paper
   - "s" for Scissors
2. The computer randomly selects one of the three moves.
3. The program compares the user's move with the computer's move and displays the result:
   - **Rock beats Scissors**
   - **Scissors beats Paper**
   - **Paper beats Rock**
4. The game continues until the user decides to quit by pressing "n".

## Features
- Repeated gameplay until the user chooses to quit.
- Simple user input validation (ensuring the user enters a valid move).
- Display of the current game result after each round.

## Example Gameplay
```

Nobody won. Your move was r, Computer's move was s
If you want to quit the game press n
n
```

## Skills Learned
- Working with `Scanner` for user input.
- Random number generation for the computer's move.
- Basic control structures like `if` statements and loops to handle game logic and repeated gameplay.

## Instructions
